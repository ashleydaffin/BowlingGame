# BowlingGame
This program is a Java Kata based on the Bowling Game Kata here: http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata

The program simulates a bowling game with the proper scoring for spares and strikes. A perfect game scores 300. 

I used IntelliJ 2020.3.3 and JUnit5 to complete this program. 

The goal is to repeat building this program in 5 iterations of the following TDD steps until mastery is reached. Master each step before moving on to the next step. 

Test Driven Development (TDD) 
1) RED - write a test, watch it fail
2) GREEN - write just enough code to make the test pass
3) REFACTOR - Improve code without changing the behavior

Step 1) 
  testGutterGame()
Step 2) 
  testAllOnes()  
Step 3) 
  testOneSpare()
Step 4)
  testOneStrike
Step 5) 
  testPerfectGame()
